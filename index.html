            <h2>Season 4 Rolled Out!</h2>
            <p>The long-awaited Season 4 has finally arrived, marking the beginning of a new era filled with intense
                battles, shifting alliances, and endless possibilities. The world has been reset, giving every player
                the opportunity to carve their own path—whether through diplomacy, deception, or outright domination.

                This season, the stakes are higher than ever. With fresh landscapes to conquer and untapped resources
                waiting to be claimed, the race for power has already begun. Will you rise as a leader, commanding a
                powerful faction to crush your enemies, or will you operate from the shadows, striking when least
                expected?

                Survival will not be easy. Trust is a rare commodity, and betrayal is always just around the corner.
                Every decision matters, from where you build your base to who you choose as your allies. Some will amass
                wealth and influence, while others will be reduced to nothing but a distant memory.

                The server remains anarchy at its core—no rules, no limits, except for one simple restriction: no cheats
                or exploit clients. Beyond that, the world is yours to shape as you see fit.</p>

            <h2>⚠️ Server Availability Notice ⚠️</h2>
            <p>
                Since Maotzedun26’s Server is hosted directly from my system, it won’t be running 24/7 for obvious
                reasons. However, whenever my system is on, so is the server!

                Typical Playtimes:

                Weekdays: 3PM – 10PM (GMT)
                Weekends: 10AM – 10PM (GMT)
                Keep in mind that the server may not be available every single day, so plan your gameplay accordingly!

                Stay tuned, and I’ll see you in the chaos. </p>
